You have:
•	3 demographics (Women 25-30, Men 18-35 & Total People 18-40)
•	9 commercials (each commercial has a demographic it will target)

Commercial 4	Automotive	M18-35
Commercial 5	Automotive	M18-35
Commercial 6	Finance	W25-30
Commercial 7	Finance	M18-35
Commercial 8	Automotive	T18-40
Commercial 9	Travel	W25-30
•	3 commercial breaks with ratings per demographic:
Break	Demographic	Rating (# of viewers)
Break1	W25-30	80
Break1	M18-35	100
Break1	T18-40	250
